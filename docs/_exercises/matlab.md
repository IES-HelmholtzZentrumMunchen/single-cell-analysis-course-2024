In this exercise, you will use another programming framework, Matlab, for analyzing microfluidics experiments. We will use mainly ready-made Matlab scripts, but it may be good if you have a look at the [Matlab website](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab/getting-started.html) for a primer in the Matlab language.
