Neural networks are a powerful and state-of-the art method to classify images. We will explore one recently published neural network, [StarDist](https://github.com/mpicbg-csbd/stardist) for segmentation of cells in high-resolution confocal images. For use in our course, please download our own StarDist model which we trained on example images ourselves. Extract the zip file in your working folder. If you would like to try this model for the StarDist Fiji plugin, please download the zip file for Fiji and do not extract it; it is ready to be used from within the StarDist Fiji plugin.
