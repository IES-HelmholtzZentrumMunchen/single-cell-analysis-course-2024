If you've already done some programming, or are aspiring to learn it, you will sooner or later encounter that most scientific software requires some degree of proficiency with the command line. On different operating systems, there are different command language interpreters, for example:
  * On Windows, the [shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands)
  * On Linux/Unix, [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html)
  * Also, Mac OS runs a variant of [bash](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/OpenSource/Conceptual/ShellScripting/CommandLInePrimer/CommandLine.html)

Especially on Unix, you can also install other command line interpreters, for instance [ksh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell) or [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell).

For our course, you will need only the most basic commands which you may already be familiar with. If you know any bash tricks, we'd love to know, so feel free to share them with the whole course!

Some commands are also directly accessible trough the Jupyter [magic functions](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) that start with `%`. We'll focus on bash, because that's what is integrated into Jupyter; but if you work on a Windows or Mac system, it will be good if you get familiar with the commands specific for you operating system.
