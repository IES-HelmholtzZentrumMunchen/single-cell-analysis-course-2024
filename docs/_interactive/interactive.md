title: Slack and Team working
---
#### Slack

We set up a Slack channel for the course. Here you can:
  * Ask questions if you have technical difficulties with the software.
  * Get help during the exercise time.
  * Discuss or get help from your peers during exercises and homework.
  * Organize and distribute the work within your group in your group channels.

##### Please do

  * Ask questions!
  * Help each other!
  * For software installation issues and problems with coding, look in the Slack channels First if your question has already been addressed.

#### Team working

For the course homework, you should work in teams. During the first exercise, we will write a small Python script to automatically assign you to a team! Use your own favorite channels of online communication and make use of the Slack channel to chat with your colleagues. On Friday, you will have time to finish your image analysis pipelines and analyze and plot the data. Each team should then present their results on Monday morning in a short (5-10 slides) presentation.
