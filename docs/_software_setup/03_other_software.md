Some free to use image analysis software that should run on most operating systems:
  * [Fiji](https://fiji.sc) is a distribution of the popular [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/Welcome) image processing and analysis software. Fiji integrates an updater that keeps many of the available plugins up-to-date and comes with a useful set of plugins pre-configured. With a powerful macro language and scripting capabilities, a high degree of automation is available from within Fiji.
  * [Cell Profiler](https://cellprofiler.org/) is often used as screening tool for high throughput screens. Under the hood, it uses some of the Python modules we will learn in this course.
  * [Icy](http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/) is an image processing platform that comes with a graphical programming interface to generate protocols for image analysis without in depth programming knowledge.
  * [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) is a general framework for 'classical' (no neural networks) machine learning approaches. It is integrated into Fiji in the 'Weka trainable segmentation' plugin.
  * [Knime](https://www.knime.com/) is a commercial platform for data analytics but offers a free to use community edition. It has many image processing methods build-in or they can be added from a large pool of available modules. Knime also offers a graphical programming language that allows to build image analysis workflows without deeper programming knowledge. It is popular in the industry not only for image analysis but also general data science tasks.
