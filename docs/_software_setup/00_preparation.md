For the Python package StarDist, please follow the [installation instructions on Github](https://github.com/mpicbg-csbd/stardist).

If you work on Windows, you will need to install the [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019) beforehand. You will not need Visual Studio itself, but when you run the installer select the `C++ build tools` and keep all recommended options as shown below:
